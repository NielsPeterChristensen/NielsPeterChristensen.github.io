    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Niels Peter Christensen. I am a Master of Science in Engineering within Earth and Space Physics and Engineering
      from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) with specialization in Earth Observation.
      Through my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in programming, data analysis, and remote sensing techniques.
      I have a keen interest in applying these skills to real-world problems, particularly within the field of Earth observation and environmental monitoring.<br>

      My areas of expertise include:
      <ul>
        <li>Radar remote sensing (SAR, InSAR, DInSAR, TomoSAR, and altimetry)</li>
        <li>Machine learning for Earth observation</li>
        <li>Numerical modelling, simulation, and data analysis</li>
      </ul>

      and I am also experienced within:
      <ul>
        <li>Image analysis and computer vision</li>
        <li>Planetary and atmospheric physics</li>
        <li>Radars, radiometers, and GNSS</li>
        <li>Signal processing and wireless communications</li>
        <li>Microcontrollers and instrumentation</li>
        <li>Satellite systems engineering</li>
      </ul>

      But who am I as a person? I am curious and have a desire to learn, which motivates me when I am faced with new challenges.
      I work in an organized and detail-oriented manner, and I am self-reliant and proactive, seeking out knowledge required to solve a given task. 
      I find that I work most efficiently on my own, but have plenty of experience working in teams. With good communication skills and an open-minded attitude, I tend to get along well with others.
      Lastly, I would describe myself as dependable, conscientious, and hardworking â€” a friendly individual who values honesty and integrity.
