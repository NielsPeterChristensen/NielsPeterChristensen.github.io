    <h3>Master's Thesis (35 ECTS)</h3>
    <p>My MSc thesis is titled <em>"Investigating subglacial hydrological activity through Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometry (InSAR) measurements and machine learning methods"</em>.</p>
    <p>
      The goal of the project was to develop a pipeline for automatic detection of regions with subglacial hydrological activity in Sentinel-1 data. This data is preprocessed using a DTU-developed software to form double-difference interferograms. I have found that it works well to combine a pretrained foundational model with a linear classifier that is trained on a relatively small amount of labeled data. For the foundational model I use DINO (self-<em>di</em>stillation with <em>no</em> labels). The idea is to extract latent features from the interferograms with DINO and then pass these feature representations to a linear classifier. It is then the linear classifier that predicts whether the subglacial environment is hydrologically active or not. I have tested the pipeline on a portion of Antarctica (10⁶ km²), and found that it works well. I have also tested different configurations of the processing chain to see how it affects the performance of the model.</p>

    <h3>Synthesis (10 ECTS)</h3>
    <p>
      In this project, I worked on the development of a preprocessing software for tomographic SAR (TomoSAR) data. The data was acquired from Greenland using the Danish EMISAR system, sponsored by ESA in 2012.In this project, I worked on the development of a preprocessing software for tomographic SAR (TomoSAR) data. The data was acquired from Greenland as part of ESA's IceSAR campaign.<br>
      Together with two colleagues, I implemented azimuth-compression using Direct Back-Projection (DBP), and phase calibration using Phase Centre Double Localization (PCDL). Finally, tomographic focusing was carried out using both beamforming (Fourier) and spectral estimation techniques (Capon and MUSIC).<br>

    <h3>Bachelor's Thesis (15 ECTS)</h3>
    <p>
      My BSc thesis was undertaken in collaboration with the Danish radar company Weibel Scientific A/S. It was titled <em>"Improved Refraction Compensation Model for Satellite Measurements"</em>.<br>
      The goal of the project was to estimate the position uncertainty of ground-to-space tracking when using a standard atmospheric correction, as opposed to a detailed spatio-temporal refraction compensation model.<br>
      I developed the compensation model using ERa5 reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and used a numerical Runge Kutta integration scheme to ray trace the radar signals through the atmosphere.<br>
